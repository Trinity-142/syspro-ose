(01)
Neo: I only ask to say what I’ve come to say, after that, do what you want and I won’t try to stop you.
Deus Ex Machina: Speak.
Neo: The program ‘Smith’ has grown beyond your control. Soon he will spread through this city as he spread through the Matrix. You cannot stop him, but I can.
Deus Ex Machina: We don’t need you. We need nothing.
Neo: If that’s true, then I’ve made a mistake and you should kill me now.
Deus Ex Machina: What do you want?
Neo: Peace.

(Zion: Temple entrance)
{Sentinels charge the temple entrance, then suddenly stop}
Niobe: What are they doing? *to Morpheus* What are you doing!?
Lock: Morpheus!

(01)
Deus Ex Machina: And if you fail?
Neo: I won’t.

(Zion: Temple entrance)
Niobe: {looks up and sees sentinels slowly circling} Neo.
Morpheus: He fights for us.

(Matrix: city street lined with Smiths)
Smith/Oracle: Mr. Anderson, welcome back. We missed you. You like what I’ve done with the place?
Neo: It ends tonight.
Smith/Oracle: I know it does – I’ve seen it. That’s why the rest of me is just going to enjoy the show – we already know that I’m the one that beats you.

{Super Burly Brawl part 1: spinning/flying battle}

Smith/Oracle: Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson, closing in on you? Well, I can. I really should thank you for it, after all, it was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to end.

{Super Burly Brawl part 2: flying battle}

Smith/Oracle: Why, Mr. Anderson, why? Why, why do you do it? Why, why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you’re fighting for something, for more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is, do you even know? Is it freedom or truth, perhaps peace – could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson, vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose. And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself. Although, only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson, you must know it by now! You can’t win, it’s pointless to keep fighting! Why, Mr. Anderson, why, why do you persist?
Neo: Because I choose to.

{Super Burly Brawl part 3: crater battle}

Smith/Oracle: This is my world! My world!

{Neo is knocked back against the crater wall and is lying on the ground}

Smith/Oracle: Wait… I’ve seen this. This is it, this is the end. Yes, you were laying right there, just like that, and I… I… I stand here, right here, I’m… I’m supposed to say something. I say… Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo.

{Neo begins to get up again}

Smith/Oracle: What? What did I just say? No… No, this isn’t right, this can’t be right. Get away from me!
Neo: What are you afraid of?
Smith/Oracle: It’s a trick!
Neo: You were right, Smith. You were always right. It was inevitable.
{Smith/Oracle imprints over Neo}
Smith/Oracle: Is it over?

{Smith/Neo nods. Deus Ex Machina in 01 realizes what Neo has done and surges electricity through his body}

Smith/Oracle: Oh, no, no, no. No, it’s not fair.

(01)
Deus Ex Machina: It is done.

(Zion: Temple entrance)
Lock: It doesn’t make sense.
Morpheus: He did it.
Kid: He saved us. He saved us. It’s over, he did it! He did it, he did it, it’s over! It’s over, he did it! He did it!
Councillor Hamann: What is it, what happened?
Kid: Sir, he did it, sir – Neo – he did it!
Councillor Hamann: Did what?
Kid: He ended the war, the machines are gone! The war is over, sir! The war is over!

(Zion: Temple)
Kid: Zion! Zion! Zion, it’s over! *echoes* It’s over! The war is over! *echoes* The war is over!
Link: *yells*
Zion crowd: *cheers*

(Zion: Temple entrance)
Morpheus: I have imagined this moment for so long. Is this real?
Niobe: Neo, wherever you are. Thank you.

(Matrix: city street)
{A black cat deja-vus up to Sati}
Sati: Good morning.

(Matrix: a lake. a bench)
Oracle: Well, now, ain’t this a surprise.
Architect: You’ve played a very dangerous game.
Oracle: Change always is.
Architect: Just how long do you think this peace is going to last?
Oracle: As long as it can.
{Architect starts walking away}
Oracle: What about the others?
Architect: What others?
Oracle: The ones that want out.
Architect: Obviously, they will be freed.
Oracle: I have your word?
Architect: What do you think I am? Human?

Sati: Oracle!
Oracle: *laughs*
Sati: We were afraid we might not find you.
Oracle: Everything’s okay now.
Sati: Look, look! *points at sunrise*
Oracle: Just look at that! Beautiful! Did you do that?
Sati: *nods* For Neo.
Oracle: That’s nice. I know he’d love it.
Sati: Will we ever see him again?
Oracle: I suspect so. Someday.
Seraph: Did you always know?
Oracle: Oh no. No, I didn’t. But I believed. I believed.

THE END
